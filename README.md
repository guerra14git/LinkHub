# LinkHub — Personal Links & Projects Organizer

Simple single-file personal link hub and small projects organizer.

This repository is a minimal, static site you can open locally in a browser to keep your important links and a short projects list. Projects are stored in your browser's localStorage, so nothing is uploaded to a server.

## Features

- Header with quick icons and a short title.
- Avatar + name area.
- Main buttons area for links (Projects, Github, LinkedIn, About).
- Projects section where you can add project title, optional URL and short description.
- Projects are persisted locally using localStorage.

## Files

- `index.html` — main page (single page app style).
- `styles.css` — styling and responsive rules.
- `scripts.js` — small client-side logic to add/list/remove projects (uses localStorage).
- `icons/` and `img/` — image assets used by the page.
